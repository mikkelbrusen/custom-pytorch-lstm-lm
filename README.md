# Language Model Using a Custom Build LSTM [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/weiji14/deepbedmap/)
This repository contains a custom implementation of a Language Model using a custom LSTM built within the PyTorch framework.

This custom LSTM was built as part of a project in the course 02456 Deep Learning @ DTU - Technical University of Denmark
+ The code was originally forked from the [PyTorch word level language modeling example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model).

+ The notebook is available on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1luim4qegwBeKVAAzW-XarPSCOhogiBQf) and in this github repo, but instructions to run will only be given for the google colab version, for which we give instructions to train a word level language models over the Penn Treebank (PTB)

## Software Requirements
